# 📚 Library Management System (Java)

A **menu-driven console-based Library Management System** built using Core Java.
This project demonstrates how basic real-world applications can be designed
using switch statements, classes, and objects.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
Managing a library involves handling books, students, and book availability.
This project simulates a basic library system where books can be added,
searched, issued, and returned using a structured approach.

## 🧠 Why This Project?
This project helped me strengthen:
- Switch-case based menu-driven programs
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Managing data using multiple classes
- Implementing real-world features in Java

## 🗂️ Project Structure

| File Name | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| `Library.java` | Main class containing menu and program flow |
| `Book.java` | Represents individual book details |
| `Books.java` | Manages collection of books and operations |
| `Student.java` | Represents individual student details |
| `Students.java` | Manages student records and book borrowing |

Each class has a specific responsibility, which keeps the code clean,
readable, and easy to maintain.
