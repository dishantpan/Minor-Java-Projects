🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Java)

A simple console-based 3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Core Java.
This project focuses on game logic, user input handling, and conditional checks.

🧠 Concepts Used

Core Java

Arrays

Loops

Switch–case

Conditional statements

Exception handling

User input using Scanner

⚙️ How the Game Works

The game uses a 1D array to represent the 3×3 board.

Two players play alternately using X and O.

Players enter a slot number (1–9) to place their mark.

After every move, the program checks:

All rows

All columns

Both diagonals

The game ends when:

A player wins, or

All slots are filled (draw)

🖥️ Sample Flow

Board is displayed with numbered slots

Player X starts the game

Players take turns entering slot numbers

Winner or draw is announced at the end

🚀 Notes

This project was built as part of guided Java learning and enhanced with personal understanding and explanations.

More Java projects will be added to this repository regularly.
