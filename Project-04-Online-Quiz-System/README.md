# 📝 Online Quiz System in Java

This project is a **console-based Online Quiz System** developed using **Core Java**.  
It simulates a real quiz where users answer multiple-choice questions and receive a final score based on correct answers.

This project is part of my learning journey to understand how **real Java applications are structured**, not just how individual programs work.

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Displays multiple-choice quiz questions
- Each question has **four options**
- The user selects one option as an answer
- The program checks whether the answer is correct
- At the end of the quiz, the **total score** is displayed

This project runs completely in the **console/terminal**.

## 🧠 Why I Built This Project

While learning Java, writing small programs is not enough.  
This project helped me understand:

- How to structure a Java project using **packages**
- How **interfaces** define rules for a system
- How different classes work together in a single application
- How real-world logic is separated into layers

Instead of writing everything in one file, this project follows a **clean and organized design**.

## 🏗️ Project Design (High-Level Overview)

The project is divided into **four logical layers**:

### 1️⃣ Interface Layer
Defines **what a quiz should do**, not how it does it.

### 2️⃣ Model Layer
Stores quiz data such as:
- Questions
- Options
- Correct answers

### 3️⃣ Service Layer
Contains the **main quiz logic**, such as:
- Showing questions
- Taking user input
- Validating answers
- Calculating the score

### 4️⃣ Main Class
Acts as the **entry point** of the application and starts the quiz.
